# Computer-Aided Diagnostic System for Diabetic Foot Ulcers

This project focuses on developing an advanced **Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) System** for early detection and classification of **Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs)** using a hybrid **Xception-XGBoost** architecture. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing foot ulcers effectively, thereby reducing severe complications such as limb amputation or mortality.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines deep learning (Xception) for feature extraction with machine learning (XGBoost) for classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of **86%** on the DFUC 2021 dataset.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Distinguishes between four categoriesâ€”Control, Infection, Ischemia, and Both (infection and ischemia).
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilized advanced techniques like rotation, flipping, and shifting to address class imbalances.
- **Explainability and Scalability**: Incorporates methods to reduce computational complexity and enhance model transparency.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost for robust classification.
- **Dataset**: DFUC 2021, consisting of 9,949 medical images of foot ulcers.
- **Cloud Environment**: Developed and trained using **Google Colab** with high computational efficiency.
